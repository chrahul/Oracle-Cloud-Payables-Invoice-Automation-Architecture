# **Oracle Cloud Payables Invoice Automation Architecture**

---

## 1.  Introduction — What is This Architecture?

This architecture is a **modern, GenAI-powered automation framework** to **load**, **review**, and **process payable invoices** automatically using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

It is **designed for enterprises** that receive invoices from various sources (emails, documents, portals) and want to:
- Reduce manual invoice data entry,
- Increase efficiency and accuracy,
- Speed up payable processing,
- Integrate seamlessly with Oracle ERP Cloud,
- Leverage **AI/ML, Document Understanding, and Autonomous Databases**.

In simple words:
> "**From invoice upload to payment readiness — fully automated, with human review only where needed.**"

## 2.  High-Level Components

Here are the **key building blocks** shown in the diagram:

| Layer | Key Components | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| User Interaction | AI App UI, Review Task UI | Allow users to upload and review invoices |
| Data Capture & Processing | Payable Invoices Data Loader | Capture invoices, extract data using GenAI, store structured info |
| Invoice Review & Creation | Payable Invoice Review & Creation | Review, correct, and push invoices into Oracle ERP |
| Data Sources | Social/Email/Business Apps | Where invoices originally come from (e.g., Gmail, ERP, Outlook) |
| Storage & Intelligence | OCI Object Storage, Document Understanding, OCI GenAI, Autonomous DB 23ai | Intelligent processing and database management |
| Integration Backbone | OCI Streaming, Oracle Integration, Integration Connectors | Move data across components seamlessly |

---

## 3.  Step-by-Step Process Flow (Detailed)

---

### **Step 1: Invoice Upload**
- User uploads payable invoice documents via:
  - AI App UI (built on Low-Code Visual App Builder)
  - OR invoices are automatically fetched from Gmail, Outlook, etc.

---

### **Step 2: Invoice Loading (Payable Invoices Data Loader)**

- Invoices are uploaded to **OCI Object Storage**.
- **OCI Events** trigger a downstream process.
- **OCI Document Understanding**:
  - Extracts structured data from unstructured invoice documents (PDFs, images).
- **OCI Generative AI**:
  - Further **formats** and **embeds** the extracted data for better searchability.
  - Creates a **Formatted Document** object.
- **Autonomous Database ZS3ai**:
  - Stores extracted examples and vectors (indexed embeddings).
- **OCI Streaming**:
  - Streams the processed, formatted documents into the next phase for review.

---

### **Step 3: Invoice Review and Creation**

- **Oracle Integration** picks up streamed invoice data.
- **Human Workflow (Oracle Integration)** triggers:
  - A human review UI for cases where AI extraction needs verification.
- **Autonomous Database ZS3ai**:
  - Retrieves invoices needing review from a **Vector Store** (AI semantic search database).
- **Formatted Docs** are embedded again with OCI GenAI for better retrieval.
- **Invoice Data Retriever** fetches invoice data back into the system for update if needed.

---

### **Step 4: Invoice Finalization and Posting**

- Once reviewed:
  - Data is automatically mapped and integrated into **Oracle ERP**.
- Oracle Integration Connectors ensure data sync.
- Result: Payable invoices are ready in Oracle Financials Cloud (or other ERPs).

---

### **Step 5: User Final Review (Optional)**

- End-user can view pending tasks via **Review Task UI**.
- Built again using Oracle Visual Builder for simplicity.
